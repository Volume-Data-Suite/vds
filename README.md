# Volume Data Suite
Volume Data Suite (VDS) is a free and open source app that can be used to visualize and interact with volumetric image data.

View the web demo app online at <https://online.volumedatasuite.com> or download the [latest native version](https://github.com/Volume-Data-Suite/vds/releases) for your plattform.

The official documentation can be found at <https://docs.volumedatasuite.com>.

## Status
VDS is currently nothing more than a proof of concept and in a very early pre-alpha state. There are many features I want to add, and the API and User Interface is still evolving. _Expect breaking changes!_
